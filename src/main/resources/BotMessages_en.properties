start.greeting=Hi!\n\
               RepostCleaner bot can help you to analyze and clean reposts from any of your chat\n\
               Unfortunately Telegram Bot API has access to the new messages only, and can't read your history\n\
               But Telegram has Telegram Database Library (or simply TDLib), a tool which allow to build your own Telegram clients\n\
               So RepostCleaner bot has embedded Telegram client which has access to your history\n\
               For that, you need to pass an authorization and connect the RepostCleaner bot to your account as a new Device\n\
               You will need to scan provided QR code by your mobile phone, so it's supposed that you open this bot on your laptop or another device\n\
               After the cleaning you can send /logout or /stop command to disconnect RepostCleaner bot from your account\n\
               Or you can go to the Settings > Devices > Find "RepostCleaner" bot session and terminate it\n\
               Let's start!
start.login_btn=Authorize me
start.logout=You're successfully logged out, RepostCleaner bot session was terminated for your account. You can /start again later

help=You can control me by sending these commands:\n\n\
        /start - to start processing\n\
        /stop - finish processing and terminate RepostCleaner bot session in your account\n\
        /logout - alias for /stop command \n\
        /help - help info with commands description
